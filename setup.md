## 4. Tips for Getting the Best Answers

The quality of your question will affect the quality of the answer. Here are some tips:

*   **Be Specific**: Instead of asking `"tell me about startups"`, try asking `"tell me about Finnish startups in the health-tech sector"`.
*   **Ask "What" and "Who" Questions**: The AI is excellent at finding and summarizing facts. Questions like *"What did company X announce?"* or *"Who is the CEO of company Y?"* work very well.
*   **Remember the Data Source**: The AI's knowledge is limited to the news articles it has processed. It does not have general knowledge of the internet and cannot predict the future.

## 5. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Why is the response taking a while?**
A: When you ask a question, the AI performs a complex search through hundreds of articles to find the most relevant information before generating a summary. This process can take 10-20 seconds.

**Q: Why did the AI say it "couldn't answer" or "didn't have enough information"?**
A: This means that within the news articles it has processed, there was no information relevant to your specific question. Try asking a broader question or rephrasing it.

**Q: Is the information always 100% accurate?**
A: The AI's answers are based entirely on the source news articles. If a news article contains an error, the AI may repeat it. Always consider the source of the information.
